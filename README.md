# Health Care Center Web Scraper

## Overview

This Flask web application allows users to scrape and view medicine prices from multiple e-commerce platforms (TrueMeds, PharmEasy, and NetMeds) and find nearby doctors' information using Google search. The application utilizes Selenium for web scraping and Flask for serving the web pages and APIs.

## Features

- **Scrape Medicine Prices**: Fetches and displays prices of a specified medicine from TrueMeds, PharmEasy, and NetMeds.
- **Find Nearby Doctors**: Fetches and displays information about nearby doctors using Google search.
- **User Interface**: Simple web interface to trigger the scraping processes and view results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver

## Detailed Descriptions

### app.py

This file contains the main Flask application with the following routes:

- `/`: Renders the main HTML page.
- `/scrape_medicines`: Triggers the medicine scraping process and returns the results as JSON.
- `/scrape_doctors`: Triggers the doctor scraping process and returns the results as JSON.

### scraper.py

This file contains the Selenium scripts for scraping:

- `scrape_medicines()`: Scrapes and returns medicine prices from TrueMeds, PharmEasy, and NetMeds.
- `scrape_doctors()`: Scrapes and returns information about nearby doctors using Google search.

### templates/index.html

This file contains the HTML template for the web interface. It includes buttons to trigger the scraping processes and sections to display the results.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the latest version of Google Chrome installed, as the Chrome WebDriver must be compatible with your browser version.
- Modify the XPaths in `scraper.py` as needed, as web page structures might change over time.
